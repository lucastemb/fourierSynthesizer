This project uses the Fourier series to model different types of sound waves. The calculations underlying the sound waves were manually computed. 

To run the program as intended, you will need to install the latest version of Python (3.11). You will also need to download the necessary libraries 
using commands listed below. 

```
pip3 install tk
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install playsound
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install PyObjC
```


Once you've downloaded the zip file containing the code and its associated files, in the Terminal, cd into the synthesizer folder 
(ex: ```cd /Users/lucastembras/Downloads/Synthesizer-master```) and run the program by typing ```python3 wavegui.py```. 

This is the process for Mac. I'm not so sure what the process looks like for Windows, but I doubt it differs much, if it does at all.
